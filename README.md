## About This Repo 
Within each figure folder, the code used to create visualization for that specific figure will be housed. Analysis was done in Python using the single-cell RNA sequencing pipeline Scanpy (python). Major supporting packages include Seurat's Label Transfer and scoreHIO. Parameters used for analysis in the manuscript can be found in the specific script used for that figure and in the Methods section of the preprint. <br />
ALL SINGLE NUCLEAR RAW DATA WAS RAN THROUGH THE CELL BENDER COMMAND LINE TOOL BEFORE ANALYSIS https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender<br />
  -Default remove-background with 150 epochs and 7500 expected cells was used

## Data Availability
Sequencing data generated and used by this study is deposited at EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress. Datasets for human fetal intestine (ArrayExpress: E-MTAB-9489, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-9489/, and previously published work for our lab (Holloway_Czerwinski_Tsai_2020)). Newly generated dataset for this manuscript are currently being deposited.
